## Description

This project is focused on building an API for a social network web application where users can share thoughts, react to thoughts and build up a friends list. The application comprises of the <kbd>Mongoose ODM</kbd> and <kbd>ExpressJS</kbd> packages that is build together with a backend <kbd>MongoDB</kbd> database.
After completing the installation, we can manipulate the database tables using <kbd>Insomnia</kbd> by using get, post, put and delete requests. This will allow the basic functionalities such as create, update, find and delete which is used to build the application that is closely similar to a social network web application.

Please make sure to install the required <kbd>dependencies</kbd> and <kbd>MongoDB</kbd> on your local machine after cloning the repository.
